# 790-Project
This project consists of three parts: STGAN, MTGAN and SGAN

## SGAN
SGAN is written in tensorflow, but the model structure has some references to the original Theano implementation:

Except the OS modules, image processing functions and the flags set-ups, most codes are written by myself.
